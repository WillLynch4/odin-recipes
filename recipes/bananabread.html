    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This chocolate chip banana bread is super moist and tastes amazing!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>

        <li>Flour: This chocolate chip banana bread starts with all-purpose flour.</li>
        <li>Leaveners: Baking soda and baking powder act as leaveners, which means they help the bread rise.</li>
        <li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor of the chocolate chip banana bread, but it won't make it taste salty.</li>
        <li>Bananas: You'll need to mash three ripe bananas.</li>
        <li>Milk: A tablespoon of milk adds moisture.</li>
        <li>Cinnamon: Ground cinnamon lends welcome warmth.</li>
        <li>Sugar: This recipe calls for white sugar, but some Allrecipes community members like to use a blend of brown and white sugars.</li>
        <li>Eggs: Whole eggs keep the banana bread moist and help bind the batter together.</li>
        <li>Chocolate chips: Of course, you'll need chocolate chips!</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the dry ingredients in one bowl; the bananas, milk, and cinnamon in another bowl; and beat the butter and sugar in a third bowl, adding the eggs one at a time.</li>
        <li>Stir the banana mixture into the butter mixture. Mix in the flour mixture. Fold in the chocolate chips.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into a prepared loaf pan and bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick comes out clean.</li>
    </ol>
